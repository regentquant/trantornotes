## Repository Working Rule

- Always commit and push after each completed action.
- Default flow for every task:
  1. `git add -A`
  2. `git commit -m "<clear, task-specific message>"`
  3. `git push`

## Git Hygiene

- Keep OS junk files ignored (for example `.DS_Store`).
- Do not leave local work unpushed after finishing a change.
