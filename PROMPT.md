This is the critical "conversion" challenge. You have a sophisticated product (intellectual leverage), but you have seconds to explain it before a user bounces.

The goal is to respect the minimalist aesthetic of your current design while aggressively selling the *philosophy* behind it.

Here is the blueprint for your Landing Page (Home), organized by scroll depth.

### 1. The Hero Section (Above the Fold)

*Goal: Instant clarity. What is this and why is it different?*

* **Headline:** **The Source Code of Great Books.**
* **Sub-headline:** Most non-fiction is 10% insight and 90% fluff. We delete the fluff, anecdotes, and repetition to give you the raw executable logic.
* **Primary Button (CTA):** `Explore the Library`
* **Secondary Link (Underneath):** *See how our extraction algorithm works →* (This answers your question about the "detailed explanation")

### 2. The "Problem/Solution" Section (The Hook)

*Goal: Validate the user's frustration with long books.*

* **Visual:** A simple split graphic.
* *Left Side:* A thick book icon labeled "Traditional Book (300 Pages)." Text below: "Anecdotes, filler, publisher mandates."
* *Right Side:* A sleek chip/diamond icon labeled "Trantor Note." Text below: "Mental models, first principles, logic chains."


* **Copy:**
> "You don't need another 40-page story about the author's childhood dog to understand the economic theory. You just need the theory. We respect your time enough to cut the rest."



### 3. The "Features" Grid (The Logic)

*Goal: Explain the specific value (The UVP).*

* **Column 1: Signal Only**
* "No summaries. No 'retelling.' We filter for unique insights and counter-intuitive facts only."


* **Column 2: First Principles**
* "We reconstruct the author's logic chain from the ground up. Understand *why* it works, not just *what* to do."


* **Column 3: Actionable Data**
* "Walk away with frameworks you can use immediately. If it's not actionable, it gets deleted."



### 4. The "Detailed Explanation" Strategy

*Goal: Capture the skeptics without boring the skimmers.*

**Do not** put a giant "Read Explanation" button at the very top. Most users just want to see a book.

**Instead, do this:**
Create a dedicated page called **"The Manifesto"** or **"Methodology."**

* **On the Home Page:** Place a distinct section (Section 4) called **"Our Protocol."**
* **Copy:** "We don't just summarize. We use a ruthless 'Signal-to-Noise' extraction protocol inspired by first-principles thinking."
* **The Button:** `Read the Manifesto` (This links to your detailed markdown explanation).
* **Why:** This signals "We are serious intellectuals" to everyone, but only requires the people who *really* care to click through.

### 5. The Footer / Social Proof

* "Join the movement against information inflation."
* Links: Library, Methodology, Twitter.

### Implementation: The "Manifesto" Page

Since you asked about the detailed file—**YES**, create a separate page for it.

* **Title:** The Trantor Manifesto.
* **Content:** Paste the "Strategic Manifesto" we drafted earlier.
* **Why:** This becomes your "Viral Asset." When people share your site on Twitter/Hacker News, they won't share the homepage; they will share the Manifesto because it's a *controversial stance* on reading.

### Summary Checklist for You

1. **Keep the Home Page clean.** 3-4 distinct sections max.
2. **Use the Manifesto** as a separate "About" page to build cult-like loyalty.
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use a screenshot of a "Before vs. After" text block on the landing page to visually prove the "de-bloating."
